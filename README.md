# Proverbia-Semantic-Engine
A Semantic Web application that represents proverbs as an OWL-based ontology using RDF and Turtle. The project integrates a Python pipeline to generate the knowledge graph from a dataset and a Streamlit interface to query and explore proverbs via SPARQL based on themes, sub-themes, regions, and sources.
